> Concept plan for adding New Folder to the 'Send to' menu in Windows 10/11.

#

The 'Send to' menu in Windows 10 and Windows 11 is a valuable feature that offers users the convenience of quickly sending files and folders to various destinations. These destinations include compressed folders, desktop shortcuts, and email recipients. Despite its utility, the current 'Send to' menu does not include an option to send files directly to a new folder. This omission can make file organization more cumbersome, as users must manually create a new folder and then move the files into it. Adding a "New Folder" option to the 'Send to' menu would greatly enhance user efficiency by streamlining this process, thereby reducing the number of steps required to organize files effectively.

Integrating a "New Folder" option into the 'Send to' menu would significantly improve file organization efficiency for users. This addition would provide a more direct and intuitive method for creating new folders and moving files into them. By making some simple modifications to the Windows registry and using a script, users can implement this feature themselves. The proposed changes will result in a more seamless and efficient file management experience, allowing users to maintain a more organized digital workspace with greater ease.

In conclusion, the enhancement of the 'Send to' menu with a "New Folder" option in Windows 10 and 11 addresses a gap in the existing functionality. This improvement not only simplifies the process of organizing files but also saves users time and effort. Implementing this feature through registry modifications and a script offers a practical solution that enhances the overall user experience in file management.
